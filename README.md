# House Prices Prediction
This project involves predicting house prices using a machine learning pipeline with a focus on writing production-level code. The main objective is to build a robust and scalable solution that can be deployed in a real-world environment.

### Key Features:
* Data Preprocessing Pipeline: Implemented a comprehensive pipeline to handle data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation steps, ensuring consistency and scalability.
* Modeling: Used a Logistic Regression model for house price prediction, including hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
* Production-Ready Code: Emphasized modular, maintainable, and well-documented code that adheres to industry standards.
* Performance Metrics: Evaluated the model using relevant metrics, ensuring it meets performance expectations for regression tasks.
This project showcases the application of machine learning in real estate, with a strong focus on code quality and pipeline development for production-level deployment.
